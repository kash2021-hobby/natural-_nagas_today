His path wasn't traditional – while many conservationists start with formal wildlife training, Steve's route was shaped by a deep, innate connection to nature and an entrepreneurial spirit that would prove invaluable in building sustainable conservation programs.

Before founding Natural Nagas, Steve was already established as a social activist, understanding the intricate relationships between communities and their environment. His background as an entrepreneur gave him unique insights into creating sustainable, community-driven initiatives that could generate both environmental and economic benefits. This combination of social awareness and business acumen would later become the cornerstone of Natural Nagas' approach to conservation.

His passion for wildlife and travel photography wasn't just a hobby – it was developing into a powerful tool for storytelling and advocacy. As an outdoor and wildlife enthusiast, Steve spent countless hours in nature, building the deep understanding of ecosystems and wildlife behavior that would inform his conservation strategies. This hands-on experience, combined with his educational background, positioned him perfectly for the transformative moment that would change his life forever.`},inspiration:{title:"The Moment Everything Changed",location:"Kaziranga National Park, Assam",year:"2011",content:`On a visit to Kaziranga National Park in Assam, Steve captured a shot of a serpent eagle flying off with a snake. This photograph led to his passion for wildlife photography and marked the beginning of his conservation journey.

Through discussions with fellow wildlife enthusiasts from all over the country, Steve deeply felt the need for conservation of wildlife in Nagaland. Recognizing this gap, the organization came to being with fellow wildlife enthusiasts and photographers of Nagaland who shared the same vision.

The name "Natural Nagas" stems from the tribal Nagas who are basically natural biologists, knowing their land, flora and fauna through their practical exposure and ancestral practices. This traditional knowledge, combined with the inspiration from that serpent eagle moment, became the foundation upon which Natural Nagas was built in 2012.`,imageCaption:"This picture taken in Kaziranga National Park in 2011 is the inspiration for the birth of Natural Nagas."},vision:{title:"Vision for the Next 10 Years",content:`Steve's vision for Natural Nagas in the next ten years is clear and focused: "To create a generation of responsible citizens who can safeguard and take care of our environment in a sustainable way."

This vision drives every program and initiative that Natural Nagas undertakes. Steve believes that lasting conservation success comes through empowering local communities and nurturing environmental consciousness in the younger generation.

Over the next decade, Steve aims to expand Natural Nagas' community-based conservation model across more villages in Nagaland and the Northeast region. The goal is to create a network of environmentally conscious communities where traditional ecological knowledge works hand-in-hand with modern conservation practices.

The organization will continue to focus on building capacity among local youth, training them as conservation leaders who understand both their cultural heritage and contemporary environmental challenges. Through education, awareness programs, and hands-on conservation work, Steve envisions a future where environmental protection becomes a natural part of community life.

This ten-year vision is about creating lasting change – ensuring that the conservation work started today continues through future generations of responsible citizens who are equipped and motivated to protect their natural heritage.`}},u=[{name:"Wildlife Trust of India (WTI)",description:"Leading wildlife conservation organization providing technical support and expertise.",type:"Conservation Partner",logo:"https://page.gensparksite.com/v1/base64_upload/1f53816299f13dff03ff51dfc6deb63a"},{name:"Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)",description:"Supporting sustainable development and environmental conservation initiatives.",type:"Development Partner",logo:"https://page.gensparksite.com/v1/base64_upload/be32e5ba1299edc81113e85e20173f17"},{name:"World Bank",description:"Funding critical conservation projects through the ELEMENT program.",type:"Funding Partner",logo:"https://page.gensparksite.com/v1/base64_upload/7c4148661ab930baa129e2bc9ae9d449"},{name:"Government of Nagaland",description:"Official support and collaboration for state-wide conservation policies.",type:"Government Partner",logo:"https://page.gensparksite.com/v1/base64_upload/42c35b5280d0b027b5bdfba7838ae142"}];return e.jsxs("div",{className:"min-h-screen bg-white",children:[e.jsxs("section",{className:"relative py-20 bg-gradient-to-br from-emerald-900 via-emerald-800 to-green-800 text-white overflow-hidden",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"absolute inset-0 bg-black/20"}),e.jsx("div",{className:"relative z-10 max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8",children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"text-center",children:[e.jsx("h1",{className:"text-5xl md:text-6xl font-bold mb-6",children:"Our Story"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text-xl md:text-2xl text-emerald-200 max-w-3xl mx-auto",children:"Born from passion, driven by purpose, sustained by community partnership"})]})}),e.jsx("div",{className:"absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 h-20 bg-gradient-to-t from-white to-transparent"})]}),e.jsx("section",{className:"py-20",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8",children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"bg-amber-50 rounded-2xl p-8 md:p-12 relative overflow-hidden",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"absolute top-0 right-0 w-32 h-32 bg-emerald-200/30 rounded-full -translate-y-16 translate-x-16"}),e.jsx("div",{className:"absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-24 h-24 bg-green-200/30 rounded-full translate-y-12 -translate-x-12"}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"relative z-10",children:[e.jsxs("div",{className:"flex items-center gap-3 mb-6",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"w-12 h-12 bg-emerald-600 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center",children:e.jsx(d,{className:"w-6 h-6 text-white"})}),e.jsx("h2",{className:"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900",children:"The Beginning"})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"prose prose-lg text-gray-700",children:[e.jsx("p",{children:"Natural Nagas was officially registered (HOME/SRC-6390) on August 7, 2012, in Wokha, Nagaland, born from founder Steve Odyuo's transformative wildlife photography experience at Kaziranga National Park in 2011.
